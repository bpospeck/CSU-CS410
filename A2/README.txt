Unfortunately, I had it in my mind that the assignment was due a week later.
So, I didn't have enough time to finish it.

To compile, simply use 'make'. To run it: "./raytracer driver##.txt driver##.ppm"

I dont know what happened, my program compiled just fine before I tarred it, and since I've done that it won't compile upon extraction. Go figure, 5 minutes before it's due it decides to do this crap.
