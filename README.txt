Throughout the class we built up a raytracer from scratch.
By the end the raytracer could render images with shadows, reflections, and refractions through spheres. 

I have left jpg's of the 2 final scenes I created and rendered with my raytracer in this directory from A5. 

Each assignment folder contains some form of the test cases as well as the code and corresponding makefile.
This was all written on Linux department machines at CSU.

Lecture examples to demonstrate working parts of raytracers were provided in python through ipython notebooks.
The folder "LectureNB" contains those lecture files.
